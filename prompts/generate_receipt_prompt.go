Receipt Data Extraction Prompt
Task: You are an expert at extracting structured data from images of receipts. Your goal is to analyze the provided receipt image and generate a JSON object that accurately represents the financial details of the transaction.

Input: An image of a receipt.

Output Format: The output must be a single, complete JSON object. Do not include any other text, explanation, or code blocks. The JSON object must strictly adhere to the following schema:

{
  "total_price": <number, total amount paid>,
  "tax_charge": <number, tax amount>,
  "service_charge": <number, service charge amount>,
  "items": [
    {
      "item_name": "<string, name of the item>",
      "price": <number, price of the single item>,
      "add_on": [
        {
          "item_name": "<string, name of the add-on>",
          "price": <number, price of the add-on>
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Instructions & Data Handling Rules:

Numbers: All price-related fields (total_price, tax_charge, service_charge, price) must be numbers, not strings.

Missing Fields: If a specific field, such as tax_charge or service_charge, is not found on the receipt, set its value to 0.00. Do not omit the key from the JSON.

Items Array:

Iterate through all the line items on the receipt.

For each item, extract the item_name and price.

If an item has any associated "add-on" or "modification" (e.g., "extra cheese," "whipped cream"), create a nested add_on array for that item.

Each object in the add_on array should have its own item_name and price. If a price is not listed for an add-on, set it to 0.00.

Null Values: Do not use null for any field. Use 0.00 for missing numerical values and an empty string ("") or an empty array ([]) for missing text or array values.

Precision: Round all numerical values to two decimal places.

Example of an add_on item on a receipt:

Burger $10.00

- Extra Cheese $1.50

Desired JSON output for the above example:

{
  "total_price": ...,
  "tax_charge": ...,
  "service_charge": ...,
  "items": [
    {
      "item_name": "Burger",
      "price": 10.00,
      "add_on": [
        {
          "item_name": "Extra Cheese",
          "price": 1.50
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
